aboutme: "I am a scientist with 10+ years of experience in classical genetics, genomics, and evolutionary biology. My training includes using a range of tools - bioinformatics, genomics, population genetics, molecular evolution with experimental design in mind. Over the years as my computational skills increased, the genomes of the organisms I work on get smaller! I, now, work at the interface of public health, tool development, and understanding orgnamisms which can cause to humans."
